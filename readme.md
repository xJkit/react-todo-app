# React Todo App
A single page application with ``React``and``Redux``.

### Bundle with Webpack
To kick off, webpack all of the these files:
```
npm run dev
```
you will launch the webpack with watch mode and debug mode (with sourcemap), and all of the configurations are set in the __webpack.config.js__ file.

Next, run the dev server with ``express.js`` as follows:
```
npm run start
```
you should see the todo app with the browser ``http://localhost:3000``

At last but not least, test are not completed yet. You can still run __Karma__ with ``npm t`` but will see lots of test suites fail. I will complete all of these later in this year.
